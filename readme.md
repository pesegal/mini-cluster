# Mini Cluster
This is a learning project where I am trying to simulate a simple microservice cluster and to try out different tools and ideas. Some of the things I want to try are:

__Tooling / Utility__
1. Service Discovery (Consul)
2. Configuration Managment (Consul)
3. Secrets Management (Consul)
4. Distributed tracing 

__Message Passing Techniques__
1. REST
2. gRPC
3. Message Queueing

The technologies will be focused around Spring / JVM technologies first, but I might try out other frameworks in the future.

## Setup
docker-compose / maven :: TBD
